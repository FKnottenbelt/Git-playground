Repository to play and practice with Git and Github

# The Garden Project

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a Developer. 
A retired one. Who wanted to spend his time working on his side projects in a beautiful garden. But gardening was not his thing. So he hired a gardener and asked him to grow him a beautiful garden.

The gardener started out simple: he planted rose bushes in the back border, yellow and white flowers in the left side border and red flowers in the right side border and a lawn in the middle.

As the gardener – per the Developers instructions – had upload the garden to Github, he decided that this was a good point to tag this state of the garden as version 1.0

Thinking it might be nice to to have flowering trees in between the red flowers. The gardener started a branch to test out different fruit trees to see which would flower the prettiest.

However, halfway through his fruit tree experiment, one of the red flower species got critically ill, so the gardener had to abandon his fruit tree experiment to fix the red flowers (using a hotfix branch to make sure he didn't make it worse), before he could get back to his fruit tree experiment.
