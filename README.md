Repository to play and practice with Git and Github

# The Garden Project

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a Developer. 
A retired one. Who wanted to spend his time working on his side projects in a beautiful garden. But gardening was not his thing. So he hired a gardener and asked him to grow him a beautiful garden.

The gardener started out simple: he planted rose bushes in the back border, yellow and white flowers in the left side border and red flowers in the right side border and a lawn in the middle.

As the gardener – per the Developers instructions – had upload the garden to Github, he decided that this was a good point to tag this state of the garden as version 1.0
